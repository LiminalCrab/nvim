# About
So I was using VS Code today when I had to stand up for five seconds.
in that fleeting moment I bumped my table, my monitor fell over, the screen broke.

Now I've gone and set up Neovim for the 50th time in order to save screenspace.

This is a repository of wasted time resulting from that.
